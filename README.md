# FinalProject
CM3070

## The template used is the CM3015 Machine Learning and Neural Networks Project Idea Title 1: Deep Learning on a public dataset.

### The aim is to develop a model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the RSNA Screening Mammography Breast Cancer Detection dataset. This model will hopefully reflect a CADe system which will be able to determine if a mammography image is cancerous or not.
